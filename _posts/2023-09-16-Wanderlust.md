## Is This Really a Blog Post?

Some thoughts after working my way through configuring this Github feature.  
by Milan Vydareny

### The Reason Why

This is a simple answer. 
- I really want to just bog and write without all the hassles of the fancy themes and templates that other blogging sites make you use.
- I also want to be able to blog using Markdown, which is a lot more sensible than all of the on-line editors that really just get in the way of rapid communmications flowing from your heart brains and hands.

### The Experience

In general, I don't do very well with instructions of the form, Click this, then click that, then type this in the edit box, and so forth. Step-by-step is not my cup of tea. Yet that's what GitHub provides as you attempt to navigate the vagaries of a Git based website. Furthermore, my direct expereience with the Githug interface is limited. As a developer I typically use Atlassian's SourceTree for repository actions, hence there was a bit of a learning curve involved in getting things to work correctly.

### Conclusion

It was well worth the effort. I'm already feeling a lot more comfortable with this system and its ability to satisfy my blogging needs, that are actually largely technical.
